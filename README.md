<p align="center">:art:The image resource repository for Constellation's branding.</p>

This repository holds Constellation branding images with the logo and lettering, as well as product screenshots, graphics and mugshots. For the different categories, you find content descriptions for all the folders in the table below. 

Note: This repository has a relatively large size of just under 100 Mb, mostly due to the >100 graphics in the 
[**logo**](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/visual-identity/tree/master/logo) 
folder.
