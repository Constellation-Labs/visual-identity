### Software archetecture

For diagrams explaining the archetecture of the protocol code base as used in the Scala 
[reference implementation](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/constellation), 
see the documentaiton folder of the corresponding repository:

* [constellation/docs/architecture/images](https://github.com/Constellation-Labs/constellation/docs/architecture/images) 

[comment]: <This /docs/architecture/images folder doesn't exist at this point, but will be added soon.>

If you contribute by improving upon existing diagrams, replace them in the respective folders.
